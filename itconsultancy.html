                    <p>.NET Application Development is centered on the powerful .NET Application Development framework,
                        which is a unified set of libraries and a common language runtime. The .NET framework gives the
                        developer all types of building blocks and development environment to make software's including
                        desk-top applications, web-based applications and Web Services used for System Integration by
                        using
                        the platform independent communication protocol such as XML and SOAP. The most significant
                        advantage
                        of the .NET Framework is its level of interoperability with other languages, applications, and
                        systems. The .NET Framework supports different programming languages. This multiple language
                        support
                        improves productivity by allowing developers to choose the programming language that is best
                        suited
                        to the job. Furthermore, cross-language inheritance increases code reuse which results in short
                        time
                        to market.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p> In the past two-tier applications commonly known as client/server applications were very common.
                        In a
                        two-tier application the client side logic is responsible for everything from presentation,
                        business
                        logic to database access. The client/server applications are not scalable, are difficult to
                        maintain
                        and enhance due to tight coupling between the presentation layer, business logic and the
                        database
                        access. Overall the two tier applications are not scalable and are not suitable for internet
                        based
                        applications
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        With the growing popularity of .NET framework, the development of an n-tier application became
                        easier and all the negatives of a client\server application development were well taken care. A
                        .NET
                        framework provides standardized modular components and a complete set of services to those
                        components. More-over application behavior such as security and multithreading are handled
                        automatically.

                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Using .NET Framework to develop n-tier applications involves breaking the two-tier architecture
                        into
                        multiple tiers. An n-tier application can provide separate layers for each of the following
                        services
                        - Presentation Layer, Dynamic Presentation, Business logic, and Data base access. A browser
                        takes
                        care of the presentation layer, and / WEBFORMS XML / SOAP and XSL take care of the dynamic
                        presentation, ASP.NET takes care of the business logic and COM take care of the data access
                        using
                        ODBC.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The layered approach allows each layer to focus on a specific role -- for example, allowing a
                        Web
                        server to serve Web-pages, an application server to serve applications, and a database server to
                        serve databases.

                <h2>XML Based Solutions</h2>
                <p>XML Application Development is one of the key technologies that are driving Enterprise development
                    today. XML Application Development promises a standard data format that can be shared easily across
                    applications and different organizations that need to share data.</p>
                <p>XML is a key technology in distributed applications. But unlike other over-hyped technologies XML has
                    been rapidly accepted because it solves very specific technical problems by using a standard
                    protocol/data representation. The simple act of agreeing to a common data format for data is making
                    data exchange drastically easier than it ever was before.</p>
                <p>Even in its simplest form XML as a standard has lots of potential as a data representation and
                    messaging mechanism. Data representation typically involves translating the data from a native
                    format into XML, and then back into the same format or even a completely different one on the other
                    end of a connection</p>
                <p>Renaissance has the experience & the technological expertise the highest end solution in XML domain.
                    We have experience in designing and developing application which require strong knowledge of XML,
                    Schema, DTD & XSL. Following are some of the examples that drive the acceptance of XML:</p>

                <h3>XML as a standard data exchange format</h3>
                <p>This is particularly useful in Web applications where XML can provide a standard, agreed upon format
                    to transfer data over the Internet. In this respect XML is similar to a data format such as Comma
                    Delimited or SDF file in the past. However, as a data representation format XML is also much more
                    powerful & flexible than these old formats. Most other text formats have been hampered by their
                    limited ability to transport complex data like memo fields or binary data. XML is very flexible in
                    what kind data it can carry because of its tag based language definition where every XML data
                    element is marked with a start and end tag.</p>
                <p>A good example may be a VB application publishing some of its data via XML and another application,
                    possibly a Java Servlet, picking up that XML data and using it internally.</p>
                <h3>Support for multiple sub-documents</h3>
                <p>Another huge advantage of XML as a data representation mechanism is that XML can combine multiple
                    pieces of data into a single document. The markup language has support for stacked and hierarchical
                    data representation. XML documents can combine several separate entities (be it tables, objects,
                    messages or metadata) into a single XML document. For example, you can send the actual data of say a
                    table, as well as a message header that describes the data or maybe contains any error conditions
                    that might have occurred in obtaining that data. You could also combine multiple tables (as an
                    example) into a single document. Or a table and an object both parsed into XML.</p>

                            <p>Content management systems are invaluable tools in the world of Web 2.0. Not only do
                                content management systems serve as a digital house for your website's content-
                                including text, images, files, and submission forms- they give you the ability to access
                                and manage complex elements of your site with ease.</p> <br>
